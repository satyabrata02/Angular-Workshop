Directives are the commands to manipulate the behaviour of DOM.
There are three types of Directives in Angular
1. property/attribute Directives:
These directives are used to manipulate properties of a element in the DOM
[ngClass]="{'classname':flagname,'classname2':flagname2}",
 you can add as many as classes you like
[ngStyle] ="{'stylename':'value','stylename':flagname?value:value2}"
 you can add as many as styles you like

2. structural Directives: 
we can change the structure of our template by DOM using these directives
 1.ngIf: 
 ngIf is a directive used to change the structure of document based on a condition or flag. 
 you can also use <ng-template> to represent a block, by default ng-template will be display none
 2.ngSwitch: 
 <div [ngSwitch]="userRole">
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'admin'">I'm admin</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'student'">I'm student</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'parent'">I'm parent</div>
  <div *ngSwitchDefault>Please check your option</div>
</div>
 3.ngFor:
  <div *ngFor="let i of students;let x= index;let e=even;let o=odd">
      <p>
        Student Name:{{i}},{{x}}
      </p>
 </div>
