what is a component?
 component is the basic building block of angular.
  we divide ui(user interface into logical parts which can be simple, meaningful and reusable). these reusable parts are called components.

  can i write multiple components in an application and how?
  yes, you can create a component manually or by a command " ng generate component component-name"

  what component contains?
  component contains .html(template),.css(styling), .ts(component/model),.spec.ts(testing),
  every component should inform to modules.

  If one component inside another component then outer one is called parent component, inner one is called child component

  components communication: components will communicate in three ways
  1. parent to child
   to send data from parent component to child component, we use @Input() in child component and attributes/properties in parent component
   @Input(childcomponentname) urchildproperty:childcomponentname;
  2. child to parent
    @viewChild:
    you can use @ViewChild in Parent attributes
    @ViewChild(childcomponentname) child:childcomponentname
    you can access all the values from child component using object child created above

    @Output(): output creates an event in child component like
    @Output() eventName = new EventEmitter(); and parent triggeres this events and gets whatever the event emits

    template reference variable:To access the values/functions from a child component, you can assign a name in parent reference like
    <app-child #name></app-child>

  3. non related components:non related components communicate through services
