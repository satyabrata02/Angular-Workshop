what is typescript?
--> typescript is superscript of JS, it adds data types to js(static data typing)

how to install ts?
1. install node js , it also installs npm(node package manager --> used to install/uninstall/update packages)
2. check the versions by going to cmd and typing " npm -v" and "node -v"
3. type in cmd " npm install -g typescript" and also checks version by "tsc -v"

tsc --init will create tsconfig file which sets rules while tsc converts ts file into js file

ts will understand datatypes in two ways
1. type inference: based on inital value, tsc will guess the data type
2. type annotation: you will gives types by specifying them exclusively

number,string,boolean,undefined,null
union(number|string|boolean)
number[] , tuple, enum, any
functions-- argument types, return type(void,never)
type alias,interfaces
classes,objects,constructor
