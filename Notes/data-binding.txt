Data binding refers to communication between component and template files.

data binding in angular can be one way or two way.
it means we can send data from html to ts or ts to html or both at a time

One-way data binding:
  component(ts) to template(html):
   i. string interpolation: you can get values from component to template as a string by embracing values in double braces
   html
   <p>{{data}}<p>
   ts
   data="something"
   ii.Property Binding:
   you can assign a value to any property of html element from ts
   <button [disabled]="value">cvdb</button>
   Template(html) to Component(ts):
   iii. event binding
   <button (click)="fun()">fdh</button>

2. two -way data binding:

we can use two way data binding to store the values or to pass communication between template and component at a time

go to modules file , import formsModule and write it inside imports and 
in the html use [(ngModel)]="value"
