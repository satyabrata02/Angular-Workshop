Services are used for common Data
How components get data from Services:
Dependency Injection: it is design pattern which creates a new instance of parent values in the child so that if parent changes the values also child will not get affected.

how to do dependency injection in angular?
we will inject the service in the parameters of constructor

For the API, you need to use default service httpClient
First goto module and import httpClientModule and write it in imports
second goto service and inject httpClient

httpClient return Observable, it means mutiple promises, u will resolve it by subscribe


step 1: go to terminal and create a service
"ng generate service service-name". This command will create .ts and .spec.ts files
.ts file is called service file 
.spec.ts is service testing file

step 2: create some dummy data in service ts file and goto any component and
inside component constructor declare a value of type serviceName

step 3: now you can access any service values. all components can access single value.

writing / declaring value with servie name in constructor paramater is dependency injection.

we can use httpClient service for API
step1: goto service import httpClient and inject as a value into service constructor parameters

step2: goto module, import httpClientModule and declare it in modules

step3: goto components, inject service in constructor paramter and call any method from service

if that method in service returns httpclient request, you will get observable.
observable are like promises but observable contains series of promises
you have to subscribe for that observable
